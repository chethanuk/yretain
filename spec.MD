2. `POST /auth/reset-password`: Reset a user's password using a valid token.

### Email Verification
1. `POST /auth/verify`: Verify a user's email using a valid token.

### User Management
1. `GET /users/me`: Retrieve the currently authenticated user's information.
2. `PUT /users/me`: Update the currently authenticated user's information.

### Optional: Admin Routes
Implement additional API endpoints for admin users to manage other users:

1. `GET /admin/users`: Retrieve a list of all users (admin only).
2. `GET /admin/users/{user_id}`: Retrieve a specific user's information by ID (admin only).
3. `PUT /admin/users/{user_id}`: Update a specific user's information by ID (admin only).
4. `DELETE /admin/users/{user_id}`: Delete a specific user by ID (admin only).

## Middleware
Add a middleware to protect specific routes based on user roles, such as admin-only routes.

1. Define a custom FastAPI dependency that checks if a user is an admin.
2. Add the dependency to the admin-related routes to ensure only admin users can access them.

## Error Handling
Implement error handling for the following scenarios:

1. Invalid input data during registration, password reset, and email verification.
2. Attempting to register a user with an existing email.
3. Attempting to reset a password or verify an email with an invalid or expired token.
4. Unauthorized access to protected routes (e.g., admin-only routes).

## Testing

The UI will include a login page for the User Authentication System and routes to Customer Management, Customer Activity Management, and Coupon Management after a user successfully logs in.
## Streamlit Application Structure1. Install and set up the Streamlit library and other dependencies (requests).

2. Create a Streamlit application with the following main sections:
- Login page

- Customer Management

- Customer Activity Management

- Coupon Management

7. Implement the frontend functionality for each section using Streamlit components and API calls to the backend.


## Login Page1. Design a login page with input fields for username and password and a login button.

2. Integrate the login page with the User Authentication System:
- Use the FastAPI users library to handle user authentication on the backend.

- Call the authentication API when the login button is clicked, and pass the entered username and password.




5. Upon successful login, store the access token and redirect the user to the appropriate management section (Customer Management, Customer Activity Management, or Coupon Management).


## Customer Management
<em>TODO: Add the Customer Management section implementation details here.</em>
## Customer Activity Management1. Implement the `display_customers_activity` function to create the Customer Activity Management section:
- Add a title and a sidebar with a select box to choose the operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

- Add a background image using Streamlit's `st.markdown` with inline CSS.

- Call the appropriate function for each operation based on the selected option: `create_customers_activity`, `read_customers_activity`, `update_customers_activity`, or `delete_customers_activity`.




5. Implement the `create_customers_activity` function:
- Add a header and an input field for the phone number.

- When the Create Customer Activity button is clicked, make a POST request to the backend API with the input phone number and the access token in the headers.

- Display a success message and the created activity details if the request is successful, or an error message if the request fails.




9. Implement the `read_customers_activity` function:
- Add a header and an input field for the activity ID.

- When the Search Customer Activity button is clicked, make a GET request to the backend API with the entered activity ID and the access token in the headers.

- Display the retrieved activity details if the request is successful, or an error message if the request fails.




13. Implement the `update_customers_activity` function:
- Add a header and input fields for the activity ID and the new phone number.

- When the Update Customer Activity button is clicked, make a PUT request to the backend API with the entered activity ID, new phone number, and the access token in the headers.

- Display a success message and the updated activity details if the request is successful, or an error message if the request fails.




17. Implement the `delete_customers_activity` function:
- Add a header and an input field for the activity ID.

- When the Delete Customer Activity button is clicked, make a DELETE request to the backend API with the entered activity ID and the access token in the headers.

- Display a success message if the request is successful, or an error message if the request fails.


## Coupon Management
<em>TODO: Add the Coupon Management section implementation details here.</em>

By following these implementation steps and integrating the UI with the backend APIs, you will build a fully functional Streamlit application with a login page and management sections for customers, customer activities, and coupons.


## Deployment using Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk### Docker
1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project with the following content:


```
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8501

CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]

```
<ol start="2">Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker build:</li></ol>
```
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.git
.dockerignore
Dockerfile

```
<ol start="3">Build the Docker image:</li></ol>
```
docker build -t your-image-name .

```
<ol start="4">Run the Docker container locally for testing:</li></ol>
```
docker run -p 8501:8501 your-image-name

```
### AWS Elastic Beanstalk
1. 
Install the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_new">AWS CLI</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html" target="_new">EB CLI</a>.

2. 
Configure the AWS CLI with your access key and secret access key:



```
aws configure

```
<ol start="3">Initialize the Elastic Beanstalk application:</li></ol>
```
eb init your-app-name --platform Docker --region your-region

```
<ol start="4">Create an environment for your application:</li></ol>
```
